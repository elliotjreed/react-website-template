# React Website Template

This template is a quick boilerplate for setting up a React project with testing, Bulma CSS, SASS / SCSS, and Typescript.

## Installing Yarn

For instructions on how to install Yarn visit [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

## Installing dependencies

The frontend uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), and is bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework is included by default.
